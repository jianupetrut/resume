								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<!--<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								
								<p  style="text-align:justify">I am a second year master's student specializing in cybersecurity at ITU Copenhagen and I have a bachelor degree in Business Informatics from the University of Economic Studies in Bucharest.</p>
								<p  style="text-align:justify">I have a background in software development, particularly using Java and C++. I have also been working with DevOps both for work and school projects, and during my courses I learned a lot about the theoretical part of cybersecurity, such as network protocols, cryptography and secure software development. I also enjoyed my courses on working with Internet of Things devices and designing high quality algorithms.</p>
								<p  style="text-align:justify">I am always looking to expand my skillset and at the moment my learning path is focused towards penetration testing. For this, I am using Cybrary to study more practical aspects of information security. <br/> You can scroll down to learn more about me, check my <a href="#work">experience and projects here</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jianupetrut/resume/raw/master/CV_Petrut_Jianu.pdf">download my CV</a>, which contains my contact information as well.</p>
								<h4 class="major">In my free time</h4>
								<p  style="text-align:justify">Most of all, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with friends. However, I also like helping people and that is one of the main reasons for which I have been volunteering quite a bit in my life throughout different organizations:
									<p  style="text-align:justify">	<h6>Ethical Hacking Club - ITU Copenhagen</h6>
									As soon as I found out that this club exists I signed myself up. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, our meetings have been online until September, but since then we have held social gatherings where ethical hackers, newbies and teachers meet and discuss cybersecurity news, projects and more. Besides that, from time to time we have presentations held by our more experienced members - the most recent one being Local Privilege Escalation in Windows using symbolic links. Also, every now and then we have fun owning machines on <a href="http://hackthebox.eu/profile/286267">Hack the Box</a>.
									I am glad to be a part of this as it is a great, friendly environment where I have the chance to meet, hang out with and learn from amazing people.
									Furthermore, some of us participate together in Capture the Flag competitions - the most recent being BSides Kobenhavn, where we won the first place.<br/>
									</p><h6>The AIESEC Journey</h6>
									<p  style="text-align:justify">	During my first year of college, March 2017 to be precise, I joined AIESEC - a non-profit organization that helps people find opportunities abroad - as a volunteer to make new friends in a new city, but I soon discovered that I was really enjoying it - the culture, helping people and developing myself in the process. I was a member of the customer service team in Bucharest(one of the 17 chapters at that time in Romania) and troughout this period I refined my communication skills and gained a sense of what it feels like to be part of a team, how to talk to eachother and what we can achieve through teamwork. We ended up winning the Excellence Award and I finally understood what great leadership means. <br/>
									As of September 2017, I decided it was time for a new challenge and I joined the organizing committee of the yearly recruiting conference where theoretically I was responsible for the finances of this project, but in practice, being a small team, everyone pitched in on everything. The <em>project</em> was considered a success as we ended up doubling our member count, but I think the most important part was the lessons we learned and the friendships we gained through pulling all-nighters together to get things done perfectly and in time. <br/>
									After that, I joined another project - in employer branding - as part of the sales team, but unfortunately I had to leave just before the end of it because my studies were demanding much more time from me than the previous year. However, my colleagues told me that it ended up great and we exceeded all expectations.
									<br/>In the summer break of 2018, missing the challenges and social aspect of volunteering, I became a volunteer in Turkey through AIESEC as an English teacher along with 11 other people from different parts of the world - Colombia, Algeria, Morocco and others. It was a great experience for me as I got to see other cultures and how people that come from them think and act, an experience that I will never forget - although it was filled with ups and downs, it still brings me joy when I think about it.</p>
										<h6>Highschool Debate Club</h6>
										<p  style="text-align:justify">For my first dance with volunteering, I joined the debate club of my local highschool and together we were working to raise social awareness(and ours) by public debates about different topics. Through this experience I developed my argumentation and critical, analytical thinking skills and got past my public speaking fear. Furthermore, it was the first time I worked in a team (the debates were happening in teams of 3 versus 3) and it helped me realize that I am very, very competitive.

								<h5>System Administrator Assistant</h5>
								<h6>University of Copenhagen - 02/2020 - Present</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify">I joined the University of Copenhagen under the Bioinformatics Core Facility, Health Science department as an assistant in system administration. Mainly, I work with a Debian Ubuntu server and a Red Hat Enterprise Linux one to make sure that the Galaxy server is running smoothly. Galaxy is a PHP + Python tool that helps bioinformaticians perform analysis operations on DNA sequences and more. The challenges started from the first moment, as I had no previous experience with Galaxy nor with Linux for more than personal use, but with the help of the person that previously occupied this position I was able to learn quickly and adapt. 
								<br/>My tasks consist mostly of managing scripts through systemd utilities, such as timers, troubleshooting Galaxy plugins by inspecting logs and keeping things running smoothly and up-to-date. The biggest challenge that I have encountered so far was to migrate the Galaxy web server from the old Ubuntu server to a newer version hosted on RedHat Enterprise Linux. This included migrating the database, switching from Apache to Unix Web Sockets, reimplementing cron jobs into systemd timers and a lot of error fixing for Galaxy plugins.

								<h5>Junior C++ Developer</h5>
									<h6>Wirecard Romania - 04/2019 - 06/2019 </h6>
									<p style="text-align:justify">In my final semester of bachelor I felt ready to get started in a professional environment and I had the opportunity to work with a great international team at Wirecard in Bucharest, Romania. I started off part-time as a C++ Developer and after a brief on-boarding process my team leader - a person which taught me more in a few weeks than most of my teachers did in years -considered I was ready for my first assignment - implementing the unit testing framework for the application  that my colleagues were developing.
									The application was designed to be embedded on POS devices, so testing it would be a bit tedious. Furthermore, they were migrating old C code into C++ and adding additional features, so a framework that could test both was needed. Therefore, I ended up using Google Test, JenkinsCI and an emulator to simulate the device operating system to automate the testing process. It was a great learning experience as it was the first time using any of the mentioned technologies. At the same time, I was taking a course on software quality and testing so I ended up designing the coding & testing guidelines for the entire software development team.
									After the two months with the them, me and my team leader did a review of my contributions to the company and I was offered a full-time position which I had to decline as I was planning on pursuing my master's degree in Copenhagen.

								<h5>Security Consulting</h5>
									<h6>10/2020 - Present</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify">I have a very good friend who works as a full-stack developer for a rental company and we started talking about the security aspect of their system. After this happened a few times, he talked to his bosses and now I help them informally, pro-bono with any security related questions and risk assessment. They use Raspberry Pi to allow access in the apartments they rent, so right now I'm doing penetration tests and damage control for this. Furthermore, I helped them design the software update mechanism in a secure way according to their risk appetite. <br/>
									I consider this a personal project because it is happening in a very informal way, a win-win situation where I can get more practical experience following my passion and the company gets free security consulting.

								<h5>Internet of Things Smart Meter Platform</h5>
								<h6>Spring 2020</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify">
								For the Internet of Things course, as a team of 3 we had to build the software for a PyCom device, assemble the required hardware and then process the data using the MQTT protocol and TheThingsNetwork platform. We learned how protocols such as LoRaWAN and MQTT work and what we need in order to build an IoT application - from hardware configuration to the end-user experience.
								<br/>For our second(and final) project, we had to build a web application to store, process and visualize this data. We designed the architecture using the Model-View-Controller pattern and used Vue.js for the front-end, node.js for the back-end, MongoDB for the database, Heroku for hosting and Git for collaboration. 
								<br/>You can find the full documentation <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/project/5eb0131a6d6a340001161151">here</a>.
								</p>
								<h5>MiniTwitter</h5>
								<h6>Spring 2020</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify">
								For the DevOps project, we received an old Twitter clone written in Python which we had to refactor and apply DevOps tools and techniques. This was one of my favorite projects because we had the chance to work with all sides of the development process and we had to scale the application for thousands of simultaneous (simulated) users.
								<br/>We implemented it as a web application using React, node.js and MongoDB, but the interesting part is that we learned to use GitHub Actions for continuous development and integration onto a Heroku hosting server. Furthermore, we used Ava.js to perform automated unit-tests on our code, Papertrail for logging (errors and other information) and Sentry to monitor the system.
								<br/>You can find the full documentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MttHqfqaiPDUhi9tqIlzmxCwFOfekOg0pWa-sBc3miA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It also contains an interesting security report that we wrote after analyzing another team's system.
								</p>
								<h5>Web Application Security</h5>
								<h6>Fall 2019</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify"></p>
								In the first official security course, after learning the fundamentals about information security and the basics of web application penetration testing, we received a group assignment where we had to play as both blue and red team along with another group of classmates.
								<br/>All teams started with a very vulnerable virtual machine which hosted a web server and we had to harden it, but leave one weak vulnerability, one backdoor to allow the red team to gain a remote shell and one way to gain root privileges from it - this represented the blue team assignment.
								<br/>When playing the red team, we were supposed to hack the other group's webserver. We found a vulnerability in their file upload mechanism which we used to gain a remote shell as www-data and exploited a kernel vulnerability for privilege escalation. 
								<br/>I consider this project my top favorite one, not only because it was a great learning experience but also because I enjoyed it more than any other project I have ever worked on and it was the definite moment that made me realize that I want to work with cybersecurity for the rest of my life.
								</p>	
								<h5>Quiz Application</h5>
								<h6>Fall 2018</h6>
								<p style="text-align:justify">
								This was the first complex software development project that I worked on. We had a team of five and we built a quiz application similar to Kahoot/Socrative in a contest organized by our faculty - the prize being an exam exemption for two courses and the application was supposed to be used by the faculty in the future.
								<br/>We built the web part using React, node.js and MySQL. We connected this to the mobile side via a RESTful API, which was developed using Java in Android Studio. I believe that the biggest challenge wasn't to teach ourselves how to do it, but how to make it scalable since it was causing erros when multiple users connected.
								<br/>We received a commendation for the best UI/UX and that led us to a maximum grade in both exams, but unfortunately the faculty board decided to not use the application as it would have required too much maintenance.
